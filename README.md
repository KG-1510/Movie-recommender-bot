## üñ• Running this locally 
To run this program locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the repo with `git clone https://github.com/KG-1510/Movie-recommender-bot.git`
2. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate your virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Then, install all the required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Next, export the Flask app route with `export FLASK_APP=index.py`
6. You will also need to export the Flask environment with `export FLASK_ENV=development`
7. Download the .csv files to the root of the project (the dataset needs to be downloaded from Kaggle)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=credits.csv
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=keywords.csv
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv

Your folder structure should look something like this after downloading and moving the .csv files in the root directory.

9. Lastly, execute `flask run --port 8000` and your program should be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
